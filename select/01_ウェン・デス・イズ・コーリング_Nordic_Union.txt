Time is moving on, I can't rewind
Facing all the fears we hold inside of us
It's black, the sky above
Black, the world below
Black, I'll fall when you follow
It's black, I can't believe
Black, All I can see
Black, I close my eyes

When death is calling
It is a road we walk alone
When death is calling
We travel right into the unknown
When death is calling

Is this real or just inside of me?
On your thoughts I love the way I can not see
It's black, the sky above
Black, the world below
Black, I'll fall when you follow
It's Black, I can't believe
Black, What I can see
Black, I close my eyes

When death is calling
It is a road we walk alone
When death is calling
We travel right into the unknown

As darkness falls and kills the light
Screaming out your name
When death is calling
You fall right in

When death is calling

When death is calling
It is a road we walk alone
When death is calling
We travel right into the unknown
As darkness falls and kills the light
Screaming out your name
When death is calling
Ooh, When death is calling
