Desert road from Vegas to nowhere
Somewhere better than where you've been
A coffee machine that needs some fixing
In a little café just around the bend
I am calling you
I am calling you
A hot dry wind blows right through me
The baby's crying and I can't sleep
But I can feel that a change is coming
Coming closer, sweet release
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
I am calling you
I am calling you
Desert road from Vegas to nowhere
Someplace better than where you've been
A coffee machine that needs some fixing
In a little café just around the bend
A hot dry wind blows right through me
The baby's crying and I can't sleep
But I can feel that a change is coming
Coming closer, sweet release
I am calling you
I am calling you
